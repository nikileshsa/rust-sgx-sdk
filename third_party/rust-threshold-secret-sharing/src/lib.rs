//! # Threshold Secret Sharing
//! Pure-Rust library for [secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing),
//! offering efficient share generation and reconstruction for both
//! traditional Shamir sharing and its packet (or ramp) variant.
//! For now, secrets and shares are fixed as prime field elements
//! represented by `i64` values.
